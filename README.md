# Sumedha
Hi, This is Sumedha. I am an aspiring web designer. Whilst I know nothing about designing I have a BA in Journalism and an MA in Human Rights and International Relations. Throughout my academic career I have found myself dabbling with WordPress, blogging and photography. And that love led me to this. I want to be able to build and design beautiful websites for professional and personal reasons. Let the journey begin!
I am here to learn a lot and hopefully use my knowledge in the future!
